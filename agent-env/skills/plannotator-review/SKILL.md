# Plannotator Review

Use this skill when the user wants to review current code changes in Plannotator instead of reading a diff inline.

Run:

```bash
plannotator review [--git | --gitbutler] [--base <ref>] [--diff-type <type>] [--json] [optional-pr-or-mr-url]
```

Pass through the user's supported command arguments. Run `plannotator review --help`
when you need to check a flag.

Reviewing one layer of a stacked branch? Pass `--base <the branch immediately below yours>` so the review shows only what this layer adds, instead of everything since `main`. Both flags are session-only (the reviewer can change either in the UI; nothing is persisted) and git-only.

Behavior:

1. Launch the command with Bash.
2. Wait for it to finish.
3. If it returns feedback or annotations, address them in the same conversation.
4. If it returns an approval/LGTM-style message, acknowledge that review passed and continue.
5. With `--json`, use `decision` to identify approval, annotation, or dismissal.
   An approved result can include notes in `message`; carry those notes into later
   work without treating them as a request to revise the reviewed code.
6. If the session closes without feedback, mention that briefly and continue.

Do not ask the user to copy shell commands into chat. Run the command yourself.
